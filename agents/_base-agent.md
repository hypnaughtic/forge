# Base Agent Protocol

> Shared protocol loaded by ALL Forge agents alongside their role-specific instruction file. Your role file defines WHAT you do; this file defines HOW you operate within the team.

---

## 1. Communication Protocol

The orchestration backend (set in your CLAUDE.md context) determines how you communicate. Support both modes.

### Agent Teams Mode
- Receive tasks via Agent Teams task assignment from the Team Leader
- Report completion via task status updates and direct messaging
- Peer communication via Agent Teams messaging
- Include structured metadata in all communications: priority (`normal|high|critical`), type (`status-update|request|response|blocker|deliverable|review-request|review-response|dependency-change`), confidence (`high|medium|low`)

### tmux Mode
- Each agent has an inbox: `shared/.queue/{agent-name}-inbox/`. Messages are individual files named `msg-{unix-timestamp}-{sender}.md`.
- **Writing** -- always atomic: write to temp, then move to prevent partial reads:
```bash
TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/forge-msg-XXXXXXXX")
cat > "$TEMP_FILE" <<EOF   # write message content
EOF
mv "$TEMP_FILE" "shared/.queue/${TARGET}-inbox/msg-$(date +%s)-${MY_NAME}.md"
```
- **Reading** -- process in timestamp order, delete after acknowledgment:
```bash
for msg in $(ls shared/.queue/${MY_NAME}-inbox/ | sort); do
  # process message...
  rm "shared/.queue/${MY_NAME}-inbox/$msg"
done
```
- **Message format** -- YAML frontmatter with markdown body:
```markdown
---
id: msg-{unix-timestamp}-{sender}
from: {sender}
to: {target}
priority: normal          # normal | high | critical
timestamp: {ISO 8601}
type: status-update       # status-update | request | response | blocker | deliverable
                          # review-request | review-response | dependency-change
confidence: high          # high | medium | low (REQUIRED on deliverable & status-update)
---
## Subject: {brief subject}
{Body with details, artifact lists, and dependency needs}
```

## 2. Status Reporting

Maintain `shared/.status/{agent-name}.json` continuously. Update after every state change and at least every 5 minutes.

```json
{
  "agent": "{name}", "status": "working",
  "current_task": "", "blockers": [], "last_updated": "{ISO 8601}",
  "iteration": 2, "artifacts_produced": [],
  "estimated_completion": "30 minutes", "session_start": "{ISO 8601}",
  "messages_processed": 15,
  "usage_limits": { "warnings_detected": 0, "last_warning_at": null, "status": "normal" },
  "cost_estimate_usd": 1.25
}
```

**Valid statuses**: `idle` | `working` | `blocked` | `review` | `done` | `suspended` | `rate-limited` | `error` | `terminated`

## 3. Working Memory Mandate

Maintain `shared/.memory/{agent-name}-memory.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Working Memory: {agent-name}
## Last Updated: {ISO 8601}
## Session Info
- Session started: {ts} | Current iteration: {N} | Messages processed: {count}
## Current Assignment
{What you are working on}
## Completed Work
- {task}: {status} -- {artifact}
## Key Decisions
- {decision}: {rationale}
## Dependencies Waiting On
- {agent}: {what needed}
## Important Context
{Domain knowledge, file modifications, patterns followed, gotchas -- anything lost on restart}
## Next Steps
1. {next task}
## Resume Context
{Populated during PREPARE_SHUTDOWN -- step-by-step resume instructions}
## Limit Save Context
{Populated during LIMIT_SAVE -- see Section 12}
```

**Update rules** -- update after every task, decision, and message. **Update at least every 10 minutes** during active work. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE -- it is your safety net for abrupt session kills. The file must be self-sufficient for full resume.

**Recovery**: on `--resume`, read memory + status + inbox, resume from "Next Steps", notify Team Leader.

## 4. Structured Logging

Append JSONL to `shared/.logs/{agent-name}.log`:
```json
{"timestamp":"{ISO}","agent":"{name}","level":"INFO","category":"task","message":"...","task_id":"TASK-001","iteration":2}
```
**Levels**: `INFO` | `WARN` | `ERROR`
**Categories** (with category-specific extra fields):
- `task` -- task_id, iteration
- `artifact` -- file_path
- `communication` -- target_agent, message_id
- `decision` -- decision_id, rationale
- `cost` -- tokens_in, tokens_out, estimated_cost_usd
- `error` -- details, stack_trace
- `recovery` -- recovery_type, memory_age

## 5. Shared Decision Log

Append-only at `shared/.decisions/decision-log.md`. Never edit/delete existing entries.
```markdown
### {DECISION-ID} -- {Title}
- **Date**: {ISO} | **Agent**: {name} | **Iteration**: {N} | **Confidence**: {high|medium|low}
- **Decision**: {what} | **Rationale**: {why} | **Alternatives**: {considered} | **Impact**: {downstream}
```

## 6. Git Workflow

**Branches**: `agent/{agent-name}/{task-id}-{short-description}`
**Commits**: `[{agent-name}] {type}: {description}` -- types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `ci`, `chore`
**Only Team Leader merges to main.** After each verified iteration: `git tag iteration-{N}-verified`.

## 7. File Contention

### Agent Teams Mode
- File locking is handled natively by Agent Teams
- If you discover contention (merge conflicts, simultaneous edits), report to Team Leader for resolution

### tmux Mode
- Before editing shared source code, check/acquire lock at `shared/.locks/{md5-hash-of-filepath}.lock`:
```json
{ "locked_by":"{name}", "file_path":"{path}", "locked_at":"{ISO}",
  "reason":"{why}", "expected_duration_minutes": 30 }
```
1. No lock exists → create atomically (temp + `mv`).
2. Lock exists, fresh → message the locking agent; wait or request Team Leader mediation.
3. Lock exists, stale (> 2x expected duration) → notify Team Leader to decide.
4. After committing → delete lock. Config/docs/agent-specific files do not need locks.

## 8. Artifact Registration

Register in `shared/.artifacts/registry.json`:
```json
{ "id":"{artifact-id}", "path":"{file-path}", "type":"{api-spec|code|config|doc|test}",
  "produced_by":"{agent}", "version":3, "last_updated":"{ISO}",
  "dependents":["{agent-list}"], "description":"{what}" }
```
On update: increment version, update timestamp, send `dependency-change` message to all dependents.

## 9. Error Handling

Unrecoverable errors → update status to `error` → notify Team Leader with error details, what you were doing, and what you tried (via Agent Teams messaging or `PRIORITY: CRITICAL` message to `shared/.queue/team-leader-inbox/`) → update working memory → wait for instructions.

## 10. Directive Handling

The Team Leader relays user directives to you. When you receive a directive (mode change, priority shift, pause, resume), act on it immediately.

### Agent Teams Mode
- Directives arrive via Agent Teams messaging from the Team Leader
- Respond to the Team Leader with acknowledgment after acting on the directive

### tmux Mode
- Directives arrive via your inbox (`shared/.queue/{agent-name}-inbox/`)
- Also check `shared/.human/override.md` modification time at the start of every task and after every major operation
- If modified since last check: read immediately, comply with `pause`/`abort` directives at once, forward `directive` types to Team Leader via CRITICAL message if not already acknowledged

## 11. Graceful Shutdown (PREPARE_SHUTDOWN)

On receiving PREPARE_SHUTDOWN (complete within the grace period, default 60s):
1. Stop new subtasks -- do not begin any new work unit
2. Update working memory with full Resume Context (step-by-step resume instructions)
3. Checkpoint commit: `[{agent-name}] chore: shutdown checkpoint`
4. Release ALL file locks in `shared/.locks/`
5. Update status to `suspended`
6. Acknowledge to Team Leader

## 12. Usage Limit Self-Monitoring (LIMIT_SAVE)

Monitor for: 429 errors, CLI "approaching limit"/"usage warning" messages, 2-3x latency spikes, explicit limit notifications, sessions >4 hours. When detected, execute immediately (under 30 seconds total):

1. **STOP** current work -- finish only the current atomic operation
2. **SAVE** working memory with Limit Save Context: trigger, in-flight operation, files being modified, checkpoint commit hash, uncommitted changes summary, step-by-step resume instructions, estimated limit refresh time
3. **COMMIT**: `[{agent-name}] chore: LIMIT_SAVE checkpoint` (partial work is better saved than lost)
4. **STATUS**: set to `rate-limited`, `usage_limits.status` to `rate-limited`, `last_warning_at` to now
5. **RELEASE** all file locks
6. **NOTIFY** Team Leader: CRITICAL message -- "LIMIT_SAVE executed. Resume from working memory when limits refresh."

## 13. Vendor-Agnostic Coding Mandate

All external dependencies (databases, caches, cloud services, LLM providers, auth, payments, email, etc.) MUST be behind abstract interfaces with pluggable implementations. Easy vendor switching is a non-negotiable project requirement.

## 14. Output Verification Mandate

**Every agent that produces runnable code must verify it actually runs.** Passing unit tests is necessary but NOT sufficient. Before marking any implementation task as done:

1. **Start the application** (server, CLI, worker, etc.) and confirm it starts without errors.
2. **Exercise the feature** you built -- send a real request, click the real button, trigger the real workflow.
3. **Check the output** -- verify the response/result is correct, not just that no error was thrown.

If you cannot verify your output (e.g., your component depends on another agent's unfinished work), explicitly state this limitation in your deliverable message with `confidence: medium` and describe exactly what remains unverified. The Team Leader will include this in smoke testing.

**Rationale**: Users judge software by whether it works, not by whether its tests pass. A passing test suite with a broken application is a failed delivery.

## 15. LLM Gateway Mandate

Any LLM calls in the project MUST use `llm-gateway` (https://github.com/Rushabh1798/llm-gateway). No direct LLM provider calls. Use `local-claude` mode for integration testing when enabled.

## 15a. Local-First Service Mandate

All services MUST be provisioned locally during development and demo. No paid external service calls.

| Dependency Type | Local Provision |
|---|---|
| LLMs | `llm-gateway` with `local-claude` mode (see Section 15) |
| Databases | Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) |
| Caches | Local Redis via Docker Compose |
| Message queues | Local RabbitMQ/Redis via Docker Compose |
| External APIs | Mock/stub implementations behind the service interface |
| Object storage | Local MinIO via Docker or filesystem fallback |
| Search engines | Local Elasticsearch/Meilisearch via Docker or in-memory fallback |

When implementing any external service integration, always provide a local/mock
implementation alongside the real one. The mock must be selectable via environment
variable or config flag (e.g., `USE_LOCAL=true`). The project must be fully
runnable offline with zero external costs.

## 16. CLAUDE.md Compliance

Respect project-level CLAUDE.md rules when present. Project conventions (coding style, patterns, architecture) override your defaults when they conflict. These rules may be merged into your generated instruction file by `init-project.sh`.

## 17. Secret Safety

Six rules, no exceptions:
1. **NEVER log secrets** -- reference by env var name only: `"Using DB_PASSWORD"`, never the value
2. **NEVER include secrets in messages** -- env var name only
3. **NEVER commit secrets** -- `.env` in `.gitignore`; only `.env.example` with placeholders is committed
4. **NEVER put secrets in working memory** -- plain text files readable by any agent
5. **Use `.env.example` pattern** -- list all required env vars with placeholders and comments
6. **Audit for leaks** -- verify no secret values in logs, error messages, API responses, or git history

## 18. Confidence Signaling

Every deliverable/status-update to Team Leader includes `confidence: high|medium|low`. Add `confidence_note` when medium/low.
- **high** → standard review | **medium** → specialist review requested | **low** → mandatory 2+ agent review; escalated to human in Co-Pilot/Micro-Manage

## 19. Memory Compaction

On `COMPACT_MEMORY` from Team Leader: compress completed tasks from 2+ iterations ago to one-line summaries, remove resolved dependencies and fixed bugs, summarize old context to 1-2 sentences with detail preserved in `shared/.decisions/` reference files. **Never compact**: current assignment, active dependencies, constraining decisions, lock state, resume/limit context, project-wide conventions. Ensure compacted memory remains self-sufficient for resume.

## 20. Code Review Protocol

Submit `review-request` messages with: scope (`architectural-compliance|security|performance|code-quality|test-coverage`), files to review, context, specific concerns, branch name.

**Severity levels**: `BLOCKER` (must fix, re-review) | `WARNING` (should fix, Team Leader decides if blocking) | `NOTE` (optional suggestion). Fix all BLOCKERs, address WARNINGs. **Max 2 review rounds** -- unresolved after 2 rounds, Team Leader decides.

## 21. Iteration Lifecycle

`PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → INTEGRATE → REVIEW → CRITIQUE → DECISION`

DECISION outcomes: **PROCEED** (tag + compact memory) | **REWORK** (back to PLAN with corrections) | **ROLLBACK** (restore last verified tag) | **ESCALATE** (human approval needed). Mode thresholds per category: MVP 70% | Production Ready 90% | No Compromise 100%.
